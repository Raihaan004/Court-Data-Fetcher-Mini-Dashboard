## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raihaan004/Court-Data-Fetcher-Mini-Dashboard.git
cd court-data-fetcher
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install Flask and Selenium using `pip`.
```bash
pip install Flask selenium
```
*(After installation, you can run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate the requirements file.)*

### 4. Download the WebDriver for Google Chrome
This project uses Selenium to automate Google Chrome, which requires a specific driver.

* **Find your Chrome Version**: Go to `Help` > `About Google Chrome` in your browser to check your version number (e.g., `125.0.6422.112`).
* **Download ChromeDriver**: Go to the official **[Chrome for Testing availability dashboard](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable)**.
* Find the stable version that matches your browser's version, select the `win64` platform for the `chromedriver`, and download the zip file.
* **Place the WebDriver**: Unzip the downloaded file and place `chromedriver.exe` into the root directory of your project folder (`court-data-fetcher/`).
