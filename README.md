Court Case Data Fetcher
A simple web app to quickly fetch case details from the Delhi High Court website.

This project was built to satisfy the requirements for Task 1 of the internship assignment. It lets you enter a case type, number, and year to get the latest case status and party details without having to manually navigate the court's website.

Features
Simple Web Form: An easy-to-use interface with a dropdown for case types and inputs for case number and year.

Automated Scraping: The backend automatically navigates the court website, enters your details, and fetches the information.

CAPTCHA Handling: The scraper is smart enough to read and solve the simple text-based CAPTCHA on the website.

Query Logging: Every search you make is logged in an SQLite database for your records.

Clean Results Display: Shows you the parsed case details in a clean and simple format.

Court Chosen
Court: Delhi High Court

URL: https://dhconline.nic.in/dhc_case_status_v1/

CAPTCHA Strategy
The Delhi High Court website uses a simple but effective text-based CAPTCHA. The numeric code is displayed directly in the HTML of the page.

Our approach is straightforward:

The scraper reads the CAPTCHA code from the webpage's HTML.

It then types that same code into the CAPTCHA input box before submitting the form.

This method is reliable because it mimics exactly what a human user does and doesn't require any complex image recognition.
